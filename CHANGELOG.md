Common Unity Libraries

v 0.0.3
Added DataRetrieval scripts. These scripts provide abstractions to read, parse and process (to a limited extent) data from a variety of source files. The concrete data, parsing and structuring in an output data format, depends on concrete implementations to be made when using the DataRetrieval namespace in the project.

v 0.7.5
Small Changes to the Base Table and Series data structures
